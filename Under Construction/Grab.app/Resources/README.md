# Grab

Grab is an application that can capture screenshots of helloSystem and its applications. You tell Grab to capture what appears on your screen and it creates a PNG file. You can then view the PNG file with Preview or any application capable of opening PNGs.

## Create a screenshot
1. Set up the screen, so it shows what you want to capture.
2. Open the ``Grab`` icon in the Utilities folder or if ``Grab`` is already running, click its icon on the ``Dock`` to make it active.
3. Choose an option from the Capture menu or press its corresponding shortcut key:
   * Selection ``(Maj+Ctrl+A)`` enable you to capture a portion of the screen. When you choose this option, the Selection Grab dialog appears. Use the mouse pointer to drag a box around the portion of the scree you want to capture . Release the mouse button to capture the screen.
   * Window ``(Maj+Ctrl+W)`` enables you to capture a window. When you choose this option, the Window Grab dialog appears. Click the Choose Window button, then click the window you want to capture.
   * Screen ``(Ctrl+Z)`` enables you to capture the entire screen. When you choose this option, the Screen Grab dialog appears. Click outside the dialog to capture the screen.
   * Timed Screen ``(Maj+Ctrl+Z)`` enables you to capture the entire screen after a ten-second delay. When you choose this option, the Timed Screen Grab dialog appears. Click the Start Timer button, then activate the program you want to capture and arrange onscreen elements as desired. In ten seconds, the screen is captured.
4. ``Grab`` makes a camera shutter sound as it captures the screen. The image appears in an untitled document window.
5. If you are satisfied with the screenshot, choose File > Save (Figure 7) or press (Ctrl+S) and use the Save As dialog sheet that appears to save it as a file on disk or if you are not satisfied with the screenshot, choose File > Close (Figure 8) or press (Ctrl+W) to close the window. In the Close dialog sheet, click Don't Save.

You can create screenshots without ``Grab``. Press (Maj+Ctrl+3) to capture the entire screen or (Maj+Ctrl+4) to capture a portion of the screen. The screenshot is automatically saved on the desktop as a PNG file.
